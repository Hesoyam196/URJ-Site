In this study, organizational principles of the radiophysical complex are proposed for simultaneous measurements of the brightness temperature fluctuations of the human brain and parameters of the autonomic nervous system. A new structure of the medical microwave radiothermograph is suggested based on the parametric compensation of losses in the circuit elements of the thermobalance. The aim of this article is to justify the structural organization of the radiophysical complex for the recording and joint real-time analysis of processes of the microwave radiation formation in the brain tissue and characteristics of the autonomic nervous system. Description of the radiophysical complex MRTHR with realization of these principles is presented. The peculiarity of the proposed radiophysical complex is in passive elements that do not contain electronic nodes and blocks and are inside the shielded cabin. In order to increase the accuracy of the brightness temperature of the deep brain structures measurement in the radiophysical complex a new structure is implemented. This structure of the medical microwave radiothermograph is based on the parametric compensation of losses in the circuit elements of the thermobalance.
