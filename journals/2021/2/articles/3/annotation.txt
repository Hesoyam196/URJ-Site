The results of the study of the features of the formation and processing of signals of autodyne short-range radar systems (SRR) with frequency modulation (FM) involving non-linearity of the modulation characteristic are presented. The numerical simulation of the nonlinear influence of the modulation characteristic on the shape and spectrum of the autodyne signal is implemented on the basis of the mathematical model of the autodyne generator. We have established that even a small non-linearity of this characteristic causes a significant distortion of the shape and spectrum of the autodyne signal. A method of quasi-static correction of the law of frequency modulation of probing radiation using a digital signal processor is proposed, which does not require complication of the microwave part of the autodyne SRR with FM. The results of experimental studies of an 8-mm autodyne SRR made on the basis of a Gann diode oscillator with frequency control by varicap are presented.
